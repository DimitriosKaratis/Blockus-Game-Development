# Blokus-Game-Development

Blokus is an abstract strategy board game for two to four players, where players try to score points by occupying most of the board with pieces of their colour. The board is a square regular grid and the pieces are polyominoes. It was designed by French mathematician Bernard Tavitian and first released in 2000 by Sekkoïa, a French company. It has won several awards, including the Mensa Select award and the 2004 Teacher's Choice Award. In 2009, the game was sold to Mattel.

The rules of play for this implementation (2 players) of the game are as follows:

1.Each new piece played must be placed so that it touches at least one piece of the same color, with only corner-to-corner contact allowed — edges cannot touch. 
2.Edge-to-edge contact between pieces of different colors, however, is allowed.
3.When a player cannot place a piece, they pass, and play continues as normal. The game ends when no one can place any more pieces.
Winner of the game is the one who has accumulated the biggest amount of points in the end of the game. 
(For every square that the player's piece occupies on the board the player is awarded with 1 point).
